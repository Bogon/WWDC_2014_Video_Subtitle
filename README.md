These subtitles content is provide by Apple, the original file is `Webvtt` format which is not a most frequently used format, so I fetch them from Apple website, then combine them and translate them to `srt` format which was supported by most of video players.

You may find some file is blank, because Apple did not provide the webvtt format file yet. Once I find they are ready, I will put them here.

Thanks to Edward, he told me some of the videos in the WWDC apps had got English subtitles yestoday and he is paying close attention to this thing all the time.
